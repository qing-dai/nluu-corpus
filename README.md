Notes for this assignment:

   proper formatting!
 - You do not have to solve the entire assignment at once, using multiple edits
   over multiple commits is less stressful and will allow you to deliver better
   quality
 - You can work on the master branch for this assignment
 - Some of the **TODOS** are marked with **advanced**. These tasks require 
   more skills for solve and are for more advanced students. Don't worry if you
   can't do them
